/**  \addtogroup WatchdogInterface Watchdog Interface
* \ingroup HardwareDrivers
* Defines a driver for the watchdog interface. This driver manages the
* hardware watchdog countdown timer. When enabled, the watchdog timer will generate
* an interrupt when the timer counts down to zero, then will reload the counter.
* If the counter counts down to zero again, the hardware performs a device reset.
* The lowest priority "idle" thread restarts the watchdog counter preiodically,
* and other operations that may keep the system busy call wiced_hal_wdog_restart to
* extend the watchdog countdown.
